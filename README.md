# Aave-Flashloan

What is a Flashloan?

Flash loan attacks refer to a smart contract exploit where an attacker takes out a flash loan from a DeFi protocol, uses the capital that they've borrowed, and pays it back in the same transaction.

Why Flashloans?

Some traders have successfully employed flash loans to speculate on new coins, without having to risk their own funds. And, because flash loans bundle several smart contract transactions into one, they can reduce transaction fees (which can add up to quite a bit).

CONCLUSION We were successfully able to write the smart contract for a Flash Loan! We were able to borrow DAI from the pool, pay the Flash Loan fee, and then repay the borrowed amount all in a single transaction. You just borrowed money with no collateral!
